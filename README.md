# Basic HoloAssistant

A multi-provider AI assistant powered by **HoloAI** with support for **OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, xAI Grok, and Groq**.
This project includes memory handling, provider switching, skill/action integration, and a conversational loop.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Unified interface for multiple AI providers
* Easy `.env` configuration for API keys and models
* Conversational memory with turn limits
* Extendable skills and actions via `SkillGraph`
* Extendable tools via `SkillGraph`
* Supports text, vision, and file inputs
* Tunable **optional parameters** for advanced customization

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:

* `HoloAI`

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```ini
# Default provider (openai, google, groq, anthropic, xai)
PROVIDER=openai  

# API keys (set only the ones you need)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
```

Optional overrides for models:

```ini
OPENAI_RESPONSE_MODEL=gpt-4.1
OPENAI_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4.1
...
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

```bash
python BasicAssistant.py
```

Example:

```
You: Hello
Holo Assistant: Hi! How can I help you today?
```

---

## 🧩 Supported Prompts

### Images

Formats: `png`, `jpg`, `gif`

```
What is in this image? C:\images\dog.png
```

### Files

Formats: `txt`, `pdf`, `docx`

```
Tell me about this file C:\docs\report.txt
```

### Mixed Inputs

## ⚡ Skills and Actions

The assistant integrates with **SkillGraph**:

* `getAgentCapabilities()` → available skills
* `getAgentActions()` → executable actions

Both are optional and passed into `HoloCompletion`.

---

## 🧠 Memory

* Stores recent conversation history
* Default limit: **10 turns**
* Oldest messages are discarded once the limit is exceeded

---

## 🎛️ Optional Parameters (Advanced)

You can customize the assistant’s behavior by adjusting the following optional parameters in `HoloCompletion`:

* **`skills`** *(default: None)*
  Skills from `SkillGraph` to expand assistant’s knowledge.

* **`actions`** *(default: None)*
  Actions the assistant can trigger from `SkillGraph`.

* **`tools`** *(default: None)*  
  A list of external functions the assistant can call.  
  - These are traditional **tool/function calls** (not built-in skills).  
  - You are responsible for handling the function execution yourself.  
  - For example, you might expose a calculator, database query, or API call.  

  👉 See [FunctionCalling](https://github.com/TristanMcBrideSr/FunctionCalling) for a complete example of how to define and use tools.


* **`tokens`** *(default: 4096)*
  Maximum tokens allowed in a response. Increase for long outputs.

* **`budget`** *(default: None)*
  Reserved tokens for planning/thinking. Must be smaller than `tokens`.

* **`effort`** *(default: auto)*
  Effort level for reasoning (`low`, `medium`, `high`, or `auto`).

* **`creativity`** *(default: 0.2)*
  Equivalent to temperature.

  * `0.0` → deterministic
  * `1.0` → highly creative

* **`files`** *(default: None)*
  Pass file paths (images, PDFs, docs) directly. Example:

  ```python
  files=[r"C:\images\cat.png", r"C:\docs\notes.txt"]
  ```

* **`colloect`** *(default: 10)*
  For animations/videos: collects the first, last, and every *n*-th frame.

* **`verbose`** *(default: False)*
  Returns full raw response structure (not just text).

## 👨‍💻 For Developers

* **Beginners**: Configure `.env`, run `HoloAssistant.py`, and start chatting.
* **Experienced Devs**: Override models, inject custom skills/actions, or extend `HoloCompletion()` with tools/APIs.
